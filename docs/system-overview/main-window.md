## 1. Server URL Configuration Panel

This panel establishes HTTP client connections to the three core services required by the calibration system.

| Field | Connected Service | Controller Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Axis URL** | `AxisHTTPClient` | Handles all 5-axis platform control, sensor reading, homing operations, position monitoring, and emergency stops. |
| **Monitor URL** | `MonitorHTTPClient` | Manages calibration pattern transmission to display monitors for visual calibration setup. |
| **Camera URL** | `CameraHTTPClient` | Controls image acquisition from network cameras for calibration shot capture. |
| **Update** | Client Reconnection | Creates new HTTP client instances with updated URLs and validates connectivity. |

The controller maintains persistent HTTP client objects (`axis_http_client`, `cam_http_client`, `monitor_http_client`) that are recreated when URLs are updated. Connection status is indicated by button color changes (red for pending updates, green for successful connection).

<div className="custom-note custom-warning">
  <div className="custom-note-title">⚠️ Connection Requirements</div>
  <p>The system requires active HTTP services for Axis control, Monitor display, and Camera capture. URL validation occurs only when Update buttons are pressed. Unreachable services disable related functionality and display warning dialogs.</p>

  <div className="custom-note-title">🔍 How to Read the Histogram</div>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Balanced curves</strong> usually mean the positive and negative shots are consistent.</li>
    <li><strong>Large curve differences</strong> may indicate wrong center, wrong pattern, poor capture quality, or lighting problems.</li>
    <li><strong>White vertical lines</strong> appear when positive and negative curves of the same direction are compared and intersection points are found.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
